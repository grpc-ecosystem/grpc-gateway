# FAQ

## How can I write the annotations which grpc-gateway requires?
Grpc-gateway follows the spec of [`google.api.HttpRule`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto).
So first check out the documentation if it is feasible in the spec.

See also [a past discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/grpc-io/Xqx80hG0D44/VNCDHjeE6pUJ) in grpc-io mailing list.

## I want to support a certain style of HTTP request but the code generated by grpc-gateway does not. How can I support this style?
See the question above at first.

Grpc-gateway is intended to cover 80% of use cases without forcing you to write comprehensive but complicated annotations. So grpc-gateway itself does not always cover all the use cases you have by design. In other words, grpc-gateway automates typical boring boilerplate mapping between gRPC and HTTP/1 communication, but it does not do arbitrarily complex custom mappings for you.

On the other hand, you can still add whatever you want as a middleware which wraps [`runtime.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/runtime?tab=doc#ServeMux).  Since `runtime.ServeMux` is just a standard [`http.Handler`](http://golang.org/pkg/http#Handler), you can easily write a custom wrapper of `runtime.ServeMux`, leveraged with existing third-party libraries in Go.
e.g. https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/blob/master/examples/internal/main.go

## My gRPC server is written in (Scala|C++|Ruby|Haskell|....). Is there a (Scala|C++|Ruby|Haskell|....) version of grpc-gateway?

AFAIK, no. But it should not be a big issue because the reverse-proxy which grpc-gateway generates usually works as an independent process and communicates with your gRPC server over TCP or a unix-domain socket.

## Why are the models in the swagger specification prefixed with the last part of the proto package name?

The reason to generate the prefixes is that we don't have a guaranteed unique namespace. If two packages produce different Foo messages then we will have trouble.

## Why not strip the prefix?

When a message is added which happens to conflict with another message (e.g. by importing a message with the same name from a different package) it will break code that is very far away from the code that changed. This is in an effort to adhere to the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).
