For generating the stubs, we have two alternatives: `protoc` and `buf`. `protoc` is the more classic generation experience that is used widely in the industry, but it has a pretty steep learning curve. `buf` is a newer tool that is built with user experience and speed in mind. It also offers linting and breaking change detection, something `protoc` doesn't offer. We offer instructions for both here.
