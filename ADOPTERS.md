# Adopters

This is a list of organizations that have spoken publicly about their adoption or
production users that have added themselves (in alphabetical order):

* [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/) uses the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of
    API requests per day.
* [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) uses gRPC-Gateway to provide the user-facing
    API of [Chef Automate](https://automate.chef.io/). Furthermore, the generated
    OpenAPI data serves as the basis for its [API documentation](https://automate.chef.io/docs/api/).
    The code is Open Source, [see `github.com/chef/automate`](https://github.com/chef/automate).

If you have adopted the gRPC-Gateway and would like to be included in this list,
feel free to submit a PR.
