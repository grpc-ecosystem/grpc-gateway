# Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is combat-proven by Google.
However, you might still want to provide a traditional RESTful API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining backwards-compatibility, supporting languages or clients not well supported by gRPC to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service. A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all that's needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.
