# ProtobufAny

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Type_** | **string** | A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least one \&quot;/\&quot; character. The last segment of the URL&#39;s path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in &#x60;path/google.protobuf.Duration&#x60;). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \&quot;.\&quot; is not accepted).  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme &#x60;http&#x60;, &#x60;https&#x60;, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:  * If no scheme is provided, &#x60;https&#x60; is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]   value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage   breaking changes.)  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com.  Schemes other than &#x60;http&#x60;, &#x60;https&#x60; (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics. | [optional] [default to null]
